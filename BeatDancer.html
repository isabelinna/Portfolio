            "Beat Dancer" is a a project which involves the creation of a
            platformer video game that aims to foster user interest in
            percussion instruments through an interactive story where they can
            learn more about them. This project was developed using unity with
            c#, this game showcases seamless gameplay mechanics and immersive
            visuals that bring the vibrant worlds to life. In this project, I
            took on the task of designing and creating captivating animations
            for sprites of various characters and objects. Through meticulous
            attention to detail and creative expertise, I brought these sprites
            to life, ensuring smooth and engaging visual experiences.

            <b>In adition,</b> we also developed a website to support the game.
            This website provides players with a user manual and a download
            link, making it easy for them to get started with the game. We also
            implemented a dashboard for the game administrators, which allows
            them to track player statistics from all around the world.

          <p><b>Here is a plot summary:</b></p>
          <p>
            In this captivating project, let me introduce you to Katsby, a
            music-loving cat who one day falls asleep and finds himself
            transported to different worlds in his dreams. In these mesmerizing
            dreamscapes, Katsby encounters a group of talented mice who are
            skilled percussionists. Catsby must cross from lush tropical jungles
            to icy landscapes, each setting offers an opportunity to explore and
            discover the diverse sounds of percussion.
